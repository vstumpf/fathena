# fAthena

fAthena is a collaborative software development project revolving around the creation of a robust massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) server package. Written in C++, the program is very versatile and provides NPCs, warps and modifications. The project is jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world as well as a tremendous community providing QA and support. fAthena is a fork of the [rAthena](https://github.com/rathena/rathena) project, which itself is a continuation of the eAthena project.

## Getting Started
fAthena uses vcpkg and CMake. To get started, clone the repository and use cmake to build the project:

```
